### 6. Database Changes

#### Migration: `AddPaymentProofUrlToOrder`

```sql
ALTER TABLE Orders ADD PaymentProofUrl NVARCHAR(500) NULL;
```

#### Models Updated:

- `OrderEntity.cs` - Added PaymentProofUrl property
- `Order.cs` (Application Model) - Added PaymentProofUrl property
- `OrderCreateRequest.cs` - Added PaymentProofUrl property
- `OrderRequest.ts` (Frontend) - Added paymentProofUrl property

### 7. API Changes

#### Request Format:

```json
{
  "orderProducts": [{ "productId": 1, "quantity": 2 }],
  "totalAmount": 2499.0,
  "shippingAddress": "John Doe, 123 Main St...",
  "paymentProofUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/v1234567890/payment-proofs/screenshot.jpg"
}
```

### 8. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**1. Upload Fails - "Configuration missing"**

- Verify `.env` file has correct `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- Ensure upload preset exists and is unsigned

**2. Upload Fails - "Upload preset not found"**

- Check preset name in `.env` matches Cloudinary dashboard
- Verify preset is set to "unsigned" mode

**3. File Too Large**

- Default limit is 10MB, adjust if needed
- Check Cloudinary account limits

**4. Order Placement Fails**

- Ensure payment proof is uploaded before placing order
- Check backend migration was applied

### 9. Testing

#### Manual Testing:

1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Add items to cart and go to checkout
3. Upload a test image (screenshot/photo)
4. Verify image appears in Cloudinary dashboard
5. Complete order and check database for PaymentProofUrl

#### Verification:

- Check Cloudinary dashboard for uploaded files
- Verify database orders table has PaymentProofUrl values
- Test error scenarios (large files, wrong formats)

### 10. Production Considerations

#### Before Going Live:

- [ ] Update upload preset to **signed mode** for production
- [ ] Set up Cloudinary transformations for optimization
- [ ] Configure CDN delivery settings
- [ ] Add backup/retention policies
- [ ] Monitor storage usage and costs
- [ ] Set up webhook notifications (optional)

#### Performance Optimization:

- Images automatically optimized by Cloudinary
- CDN delivery for fast loading
- Progressive upload with preview
